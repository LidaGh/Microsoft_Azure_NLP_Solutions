# Overview 
This repo breifly introduce AI and NLP with an comperhensive overview of Microsoft Azure AI and NLP solutions. It then provides a mapping between NLP applications and Azure AI solutions, wich also contains the links to the Microsoft official NLP repositories. 

# Target Audience
For this repository our target audience includes developers, data scientists and machine learning engineers with varying levels of NLP knowledge who are seeking an easy guide to try Azure AI/NLP solutions. 


# What is NLP?
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of **artificial intelligence**, **machine learning**, and **computational linguistics**. Its primary goal is the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages incudling text, image and speech. 

In particular, NLP provides different techniques of how a computer program can **understand**, **analyse**, and potentially **generate large volume** of human language data.

NLP applications include **natural language understanding**, **machine translation**, **semantics** , **the syntactic passing**, **natural language emulation**, **dialectal systems** such as **speech recognition**, **question & answering** and a broad range of **text analytics techniques** such as topic modelling, classification, summarization, ranking and generation tasks.

## Breif History of AI and NLP 
In seventeenth century, two philosophers proposed some theories for machine translation, but none resulted in development of an actual machine. The first patents for "translating machines" were applied for in the mid-1930s, creation of automated bilingual dictionary with various ligustic features. 
The breakthrough in AI -and NLP in particular- happened in 1950, when Alan Turing, an Englsih mathematian, published his famous article "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" and proposed what is now called the ['Turing test'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test). 

Turing test is used to determine whether or not computer(machine) can think intelligently like human?. This criterion depends on the ability of a computer program to impersonate a human in a real-time written conversation with a human judge, sufficiently well that the judge is unable to distinguish reliably — on the basis of the conversational content alone — between the program and a real human.

# Microsoft Azure AI 
The Microsoft AI platform provides a suite of powerful tools to allow developers to easily and quickly infuse AI into their applications and scenarios, enabling new, intelligent experiences for their users.

# Getting Started
Microosft Azure AI can be used for NLP applications for three 

## Pre_built AI:
### A) Azure Cognitive Services:
These solutions are there APIs, SDKs, and services available to help developers build intelligent applications without having direct AI or data science skills or knowledge. Azure Cognitive Services enable developers to easily add cognitive features into their applications. The goal of Azure Cognitive Services is to help developers create applications that can see, hear, speak, understand, and even begin to reason.The catalog of services within Azure Cognitive Services can be categorized into five main pillars - Vision, Speech, Language, Web Search, and Decision.

- [Form Recognizer Recipes](https://github.com/microsoft/knowledge-extraction-recipes-forms)

## Custom AI: 

 ### Machine learning and Deep Learning solutions: 
Microsoft research has published a repository contains examples and best practices for building NLP systems, provided as Jupyter notebooks and utility functions. The focus of the repository is on state-of-the-art methods and common scenarios that are popular among researchers and practitioners working on problems involving text and language.
