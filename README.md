# Azure_NLPSolutions
Natural Language Processing (NLP) (also known as Neuro Linguistic Programming) is a field of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and the computational linguistics. The sub-areas include natural language understanding, machine translation, semantics and the syntactic passing, natural language emulation, dialectal systems and a broad range of text analytics techniques such as classification, ranking and generation tasks. In this repo, we briefly review different NLP applications and discuss Microsoft Azure cloud solutions -including LUIS, Cognitive Services, and text analytics recipes in Deep learning- available for various NLP scenarios. 

 

Outcomes from attending the call 

Brief summary of NLP techniques and its applications 

Overall understanding of Cognitive Services capabilities as Azure ready-built solutions for Question/Answering and Knowledge Mining tasks 

Overview of deep learning models developed for NLP tasks and knowing about the Microsoft research NLP recipes repository that contains examples and best practices for building NLP systems, provided as Jupyter notebooks and utility functions. 

Why is it important to partners? 

The audience of the webinar will be able to understand the foundation of NLP techniques and its applications. This talk will also enable them to get familiar with Azure NLP solutions and their capabilities of how and when to use different services for their NLP scenarios.  

There are primarily two types of Language Models:
	1. Statistical Language Models: These models use traditional statistical techniques like N-grams, Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and certain linguistic rules to learn the probability distribution of words.
	2. Neural Language Models: These are new players in the NLP town and have surpassed the statistical language models in their effectiveness. They use different kinds of Neural Networks to model language.
