# Understanding NLP
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of **artificial intelligence**, **machine learning**, and **computational linguistics**. Its primary goal is the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages. 

In particular, NLP provides different techniques of how a computer program can **understand**, **analyse**, and potentially **generate large volume** of human language data.

NLP applications include **natural language understanding**, **machine translation**, **semantics** , **the syntactic passing**, **natural language emulation**, **dialectal systems** such as **speech recognition**, **question & answering** and a broad range of **text analytics techniques** such as topic modelling, classification, summarization, ranking and generation tasks.

# Breif History of AI and NLP 
In seventeenth century, two philosophers proposed some theories for machine translation, but none resulted in development of an actual machine. The first patents for "translating machines" were applied for in the mid-1930s, creation of automated bilingual dictionary with various ligustic features. 
The breakthrough in AI -and NLP in particular- happened in 1950, when Alan Turing, an Englsih mathematian, published his famous article "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" and proposed what is now called the ['Turing test'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test). 

Turing test is used to determine whether or not computer(machine) can think intelligently like human?. This criterion depends on the ability of a computer program to impersonate a human in a real-time written conversation with a human judge, sufficiently well that the judge is unable to distinguish reliably — on the basis of the conversational content alone — between the program and a real human.
