Microosft Azure AI services apply NLP techniques for two types of solutions: 


[ Knowledge extraction also known as (Information Extraction (IE)) is one of the main techniques of NLP which is the task of automatically extracting knowledge from structured/semi-structured (XML, RDF, HTML) documnets or unstructured (text, images, speech) resources. This task can be done at different lingustice levels.  
 
 ## Language Models
Building a language models are the most advanced NLP tasks, such as **word embedding**, **classification**, **summarization**, **document similarities** are implemented by deep learning techniques.]

## Pre_built AI:
### A) Azure Cognitive Services:
These solutions are there APIs, SDKs, and services available to help developers build intelligent applications without having direct AI or data science skills or knowledge. Azure Cognitive Services enable developers to easily add cognitive features into their applications. The goal of Azure Cognitive Services is to help developers create applications that can see, hear, speak, understand, and even begin to reason.The catalog of services within Azure Cognitive Services can be categorized into five main pillars - Vision, Speech, Language, Web Search, and Decision.

### B) Knowledge Mining solutions:
These solutions are designed for advanced knowlege mining tasks, such as Name Entity Recognition, Phrase Extraction, Custom labeling and Custom skills, where can enrich the IE porcess.

- [Form Recognizer Recipes](https://github.com/microsoft/knowledge-extraction-recipes-forms)

## Custom AI: 

 ### Machine learning and Deep Learning solutions: 
Microsoft research has published a repository contains examples and best practices for building NLP systems, provided as Jupyter notebooks and utility functions. The focus of the repository is on state-of-the-art methods and common scenarios that are popular among researchers and practitioners working on problems involving text and language.
